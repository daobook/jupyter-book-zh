# Change Log

## v0.11.1

This release included two minor patches brought in via updates to `sphinx-external-toc` and `jupyterbook-latex`.

## v0.11.0

([full changelog](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/compare/v0.10.2...d43216c57a2710eaeb2363f21d2b3aadf914feca)) | [GitHub contributors page for this release](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/graphs/contributors?from=2021-04-04&to=2021-05-11&type=c)

This is primarily a documentation and under-the-hood update, but it comes with an important change to the way that **Table of Contents** are structured. See below for more information.

### Breaking ‼

- **Table of Contents**. The Table of Contents infrastructure is now handled by the Sphinx extension [`sphinx-external-toc`](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-external-toc). This comes with a more structured format for `_toc.yaml` through the introduction of `jb-article` and `jb-book` formats. In order to convert your book's TOC to the new format, you may run the following command:

  ```
  jupyter-book toc migrate _toc.yml -o _toc.yml
  ```

  This command includes `-o` which will update your current `_toc.yml` file to work with the latest `jupyter-book` release.

  See the [Table of Contents documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/customize/toc.html) for more information.

### New

- The `_toc.yml` file now has support to use `glob` to add files based on a pattern to the table of contents. This
  is added using the `glob` key where you would usually specify a `file` or `url`.

  ```yaml
  root: intro
  subtrees:
  - entries:
    - file: doc1
    - url: https://example.com
    - glob: subfolder/other*
  ```

  this matches any documents that start with `other` that are contained in `subfolder`. [Fixes [Issue #1038](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/issues/1038)]

- Input files to the `_toc.yml` no longer need to be just `ipynb`, `md`, `rst`. You can now use [custom file types](https://jupyterbook.org/file-types/jupytext.html#file-types-custom) as an input such as `py` files. (Fixes [Issue #1064](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/issues/1064), [Issue #1175](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/issues/1175))

- The `jupyterbook toc` command has now been converted to a collection of tools. It was originally setup to read a collection of files and then build a `_toc.yml`. The equivalent of this command is now:

  ```bash
  jupyter-book toc from-project
  ```

  There is also an additional helper tool that builds a collection of files from a user written `_toc.yml` file using

  ```bash
  jupyter-book toc to-project
  ```

## v0.10.1 2021-03-02

[full changelog](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/compare/v0.10.0...a73538c22d6c8c7b7b198db79ada0f801d685856) | [GitHub contributors page for this release](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/graphs/contributors?from=2021-01-30&to=2021-03-02&type=c)

This is a minor update to include recent improvements made to [MyST-NB](https://github.com/executablebooks/myst-nb)

### New

1. An **experimental** MyST-NB feature that enables loading of code from a file for `code-cell` directives using a `:load: <file>` option. Additional information is available in the [myst-nb documentation](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use/markdown.html#syntax-for-code-cells)

### Upgrades

* ⬆ UPGRADE: myst-nb v0.12.0 ([#1238](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/pull/1238), [@mmcky](https://github.com/mmcky))

### Maintain

* 🔧 MAINTAIN: Expand `jupytext` version pinning ([#1221](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/pull/1221), [@bollwyvl](https://github.com/bollwyvl))

## v0.10.0 2021-02-01

[full changelog](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/compare/v0.9.1...d3c78097edda4fefb672e32344c3806c9cdc7a72) | [GitHub contributors page for this release](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/graphs/contributors?from=2020-12-22&to=2021-01-30&type=c)

This update focuses on new syntax features for MyST markdown, as well as a new configuration to enable MyST extensions. See below for more details.

### New

MyST Parser version 0.13.x

: The MyST-NB and MyST-parser have both been upgraded.
  This comes with support for new syntax and a new configuration mechanism (see below for some examples).

  (see also [the myst-parser changelog](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/v0.13.3/develop/_changelog.html#id4) for more information about the syntax additions)

New `myst` extension configuration

: The `myst_extended_syntax` configuration is **now deprecated**, in lieu of a more flexible extension mechanism.
  You may now enable individual `myst` extensions by adding them to the following section of your `_config.yml` file:
  ```yaml
  parse:
    myst_enable_extensions:
      - <list-of-extensions>
  ```
  See the [MyST syntax extension section here](./content/content-blocks.md) for more information.

Citations and references configuration

: This version comes with a version bump to `sphinxcontrib.bibtex v2.1.*`. This introduces new configuration for connecting your bibfiles (no longer using the bibliography directive), and makes the citation resolution process much more stable and dependable.
: See [](content:citations) for more information, and the [`sphinxcontrib.bibtex` documentation](https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information about updates in the latest version.

TOC depth numbering

: You can now set the depth of numbering (e.g., 3.2 vs. 3.2.1) via the the `numbered` flag in your Table of Contents.
  See [the table of contents documentation](./customize/toc.md) for more information.


### New MyST syntax

MyST Markdown substitutions**

: Substitutions allow you to define **variables** in markdown, and insert them elsewhere in your document.
  This lets you change the variable value and have it automatically update throughout your book.
  This is **on by default**.
  See [](content:substitutions) for more information.

Automatic HTML links

: The `linkify` extension will automatically identify “bare” web URLs, like `www.example.com`,  and add hyperlinks; www.example.com.
  This extension is **on by default**.

Smart Quotes

: The `smartquotes` extension will automatically convert standard quotations to their opening/closing variants:

  - `'single quotes'`: ‘single quotes’
  - `"double quotes"`:  “double quotes”

  This extension is **off by default**.
  See [this documentation](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/v0.13.3/using/syntax-optional.html#typography) for more details.

Typography replacements for common characters

: The `replacements` extension will automatically convert some common typographic texts, such as `+-` -> `±`.
  This extension is **off by default**.
  See [this documentation](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/v0.13.3/using/syntax-optional.html#typography) for more details.

HTML admonitions

: By adding `"html_admonition"` to `myst_enable_extensions`, you can enable parsing of `<div class="admonition">` HTML blocks to sphinx admonitions.
  This is helpful when you care about viewing the "source" Markdown, such as in Jupyter Notebooks.
  For example:
  ```html
  <div class="admonition note" name="html-admonition">
  <p class="title">This is the **title**</p>
  This is the *content*
  </div>
  ```
  See [](content-blocks:html-admonitions) for further information.
  This extension is **off by default**.

### Deprecations

`myst_extended_syntax` is deprecated

: See above for new configuration details.

Colon fences now behave like directives

: The `colon_fence` extension (replacing `admonition_enable`) now works exactly the same as normal ```` ``` ```` code fences, but using `:::` delimiters.
  This is helpful for directives that contain Markdown text, for example:

  ```md
  :::{admonition} The title
  :class: note

  This note contains *Markdown*
  :::
  ```

Bibliographies no longer use a path to a bibtex file

: See above for new configuration details.

## v0.9.1 2020-12-22

This is a minor release to issue `v0.9` to PyPI and updates a broken link that prohibited the `v0.9.0` PyPI release action.

## v0.9.0 2020-12-09

([full changelog](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/compare/v0.8.3...6c30f554d86fe7d1a0e4ad05012a5de4133117d0))

## v0.8.1 2020-09-09

### New ✨

Add `jupyter-book create --cookiecutter` (thanks to [@TomasBeuzen](https://github.com/TomasBeuzen))
: This adds a `--cookiecutter` option to `jb create`, to allow users to use the [Jupyter Book cookiecutter](https://github.com/executablebooks/cookiecutter-jupyter-book) to create a book template.

  The cookiecutter is suitable for more advanced users that want to create a ready-to-go repository to host their book that includes pre-populated metafiles such as README, LICENSE, CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING, etc., as well as GitHub Actions workflow files.

### Fixes 🐛

This release contains numerous improvements, to the documentation and code, to address issues noted by you guys:

- Fix issues with single document builds (e.g. pdflatex) and relative path resolutions
- Ensure `sphinx-book-theme` is loaded on PDF builds (to allow the use of the `margin` directive)
- Allow execution `timeout: -1` and `execute_notebooks: off` to be valid in the `_config.yml`

## v0.8.0 2020-09-01

([full changelog](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book/compare/v0.7.5...v0.8.0))

> **You spoke, we listened!**

Version 0.8.0 of Jupyter Book, incorporates a bottom-up refresh of the entire Executable Books Project (EBP) stack,
with tonnes of bugs fixes, improvements and new features 🎉

The documentation describes all this new functionality in full detail, but below we shall try to outline the major changes and additions.

### Breaking ‼️

The `jupyter-book`/`jb` executable should work almost identically to in v0.7.5, and all existing books will generally build as before (open an issue if not!).

The key change is that `jupyter-book page` is no longer available.
Instead you can now pass a single file path to `jupyter-book build`, as opposed to a directory, and it will build your single page (thanks to [@AakashGfude](https://github.com/AakashGfude)).
See [Build a standalone page](./start/build.md).

Another thing to note, is that if you are using "bare" LaTeX math in your documentation,
then this will only render if you activate in your `_config.yml`:

```yaml
parse:
  myst_extended_syntax: true
```

See [the math documentation](./content/math.md) for details.

### New and Improved ✨👌

Jupyter Book v0.8 incorporates all the great new features available by moving from:

* MyST-Parser v0.9 to v0.12 (see its [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md))
* MyST-NB v0.8 to v0.10 (see its [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-NB/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md))
* This also enabled, Sphinx v2 to v3

Here's the headlines:

Windows support
: Continuous Integration (CI) testing is now run against Windows OS throughout the EBP stack.
  The fixes this entailed, mean that Jupyter Book can now be run on Windows with minimal issue (see [Working on Windows](./advanced/windows.md))

Extended "Markdown friendly" syntaxes
: MyST Markdown directives offer a high degree of extensibility, to add all the features we might need to create a scientific document.
  However, they are not (yet) very well integrated with external editors, like the Jupyter Notebook interface.
  Extended syntax parsing to the rescue!

  By enabling in your `_config.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  parse:
    myst_extended_syntax: true
  ```

  You can access to a number of *Markdown friendly* syntaxes, which extend the [CommonMark specification](https://commonmark.org/):

  * `:::` fenced admonitions render Markdown as standard (see [new style admonitions](./content/content-blocks.md)).
  * HTML images are correctly handled, allowing for control of size and style attributes,
    and Markdown style figures extend this for captions and referencing (see [images and figures](./content/figures.md)).
  * Definition lists are what you see here and provide a simple format for writing term/definition blocks (see [definition lists](./content/content-blocks.md)).
  * LaTeX math is now intrinsically supported,
    meaning that it will rendered correctly in both HTML and LaTeX/PDF outputs (see [math and equations](./content/math.md)).

Custom Notebook Formats
: Want to write your notebooks as RMarkdown, Python files, ....?
  Jupyter Book now supports linking any file extension to a custom conversion function,
  run before notebook execution and parsing.
  See the [custom notebook formats and Jupytext](./file-types/jupytext.Rmd) documentation, which itself is written in RMarkdown!

Execution Configuration
: Execution and caching of notebook outputs has been improved, to make it more consistent across `auto` and `cache` methods (`cache` execution is now also run in the notebook directory) and provide numerous configuration options, including:

  * Running the execution in the local directory or in a temporary directory.
  * Setting the execution timeout limit, at a global or notebook level.
  * Allowing errors across all notebooks, or at a notebook or cell level.
  * Removing stderr/stdout outputs or logging warnings when they are encountered
  * A directive for displaying execution statistics for all notebooks in the book (status, run time, etc)

  See the [execution documentation](./content/execute.md) for more details.

Code Output Formatting
: More cell outputs are handled, including Markdown and ANSI outputs,
  and you can use cell metadata to set image size, style, captions and references.
  See [formatting code outputs](./content/code-outputs.md).

Build options and error reporting
: The `jupyter-book build` command includes additional options/flags for controlling the build behaviour,
  such as verbose (`-v`), quiet (`-q`) and nitpick mode for checking references (`-n`).
  See the [command-line interface documentation](./reference/cli.md) for more details.

sphinx-panels integration
: The [sphinx-panels](https://sphinx-panels.readthedocs.io) package is now provided directly in the Jupyter Book distribution.
  This adds additional functionality for creating web based elements, such as gridded panels and dropdown boxes.
  See the [Panels and Dropdowns](./content/content-blocks.md) section for details.

### Fixes 🐛

Among the numerous fixes:

* Code cell syntax highlighting now works for all Jupyter kernels.
* User configuration is now recursively merged with the default configuration, and no longer overwrites an entire nested section.
  You can also use `jb config sphinx mybookname/` to inspect the sphinx `conf.py` which will be parsed to the builder.

### More to come 👀

We have many more improvements planned, check back in this change log for future improvements.

Also please continue to provide us feedback on what you would like to see next.
See our [voting for new features](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/feature-vote.html) page.

## v0.7.5 2020-08-26

✨ NEW: This release introduces the new "Comments and Annotations" feature, powered by [sphinx-comments](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-comments). See [this documentation section](https://jupyterbook.org/interactive/comments.html) for further details.

**Important:** this version also pins the `myst-nb` dependency to v0.8.
Previous versions erroneously allow for the new v0.9, which is not yet strictly compatible with jupyter-book (coming very soon!)
