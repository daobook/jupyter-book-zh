# Add metadata to your book pages

Metadata is information about a book or its content.
It is often used to control the behavior of Jupyter Book and its features.
This is a short guide to how metadata is added to various kinds of content in Jupyter Book.

## Add metadata to notebooks

You can control the behaviour of Jupyter Book by putting custom tags
in the metadata of your cells. This allows you to do things like
{doc}`automatically hide code cells <../interactive/hiding>` as well as
{ref}`add interactive widgets to cells <launch:thebe>`.

### Adding tags using notebook interfaces

There are two straightforward ways to add metadata to cells:

1. **Use the Jupyter Notebook cell tag editor**. The Jupyter Notebook ships with a
   cell tag editor by default. This lets you add cell tags to each cell quickly.

   To enable the cell tag editor, click `View -> Cell Toolbar -> Tags`. This
   will enable the tags UI. Here's what the menu looks like.

2. **Use the JupyterLab Cell Tags plugin**. JupyterLab is an IDE-like Jupyter
   environment that runs in your browser. It has a "cell tags" plugin built-in,
   which exposes a user interface that lets you quickly insert cell tags.

   You'll find tags under the "wrench" menu section.
   Here's what the tags UI in JupyterLab looks like.

Tags are actually just a special section of cell level metadata.
There are three levels of metadata:

* For notebook level: in the Jupyter Notebook Toolbar go to `Edit -> Edit Notebook Metadata`
* For cell level: in the Jupyter Notebook Toolbar go to `View -> Cell Toolbar -> Edit Metadata` and a button will appear above each cell.
* For output level: using e.g. `IPython.display.display(obj,metadata={"tags": [])`, you can set metadata specific to a certain output (but Jupyter Book does not utilize this just yet).

### Add tags using MyST Markdown notebooks

If you're writing notebooks with MyST Markdown, then you can add tags to each code cell when you write the `{code-cell}` block. For example, below we:

````
```{code-cell}
:tags: [tag1,tag2,tag3]
print("some code")
```
````

Will create a code cell with those three tags attached to it. For more information about MyST Markdown notebooks, see [](../file-types/myst-notebooks.md).

### Add tags using Python code

Sometimes you'd like to quickly scan through a notebook's cells in order to
add tags based on the content of the cell. For example, you might want to
hide any cell with an import statement in it using the `remove-input` tag.

Here's a short Python snippet to accomplish something close to this.
First change directories into the root of your book folder, and then
run the script below as a Python script or within a Jupyter Notebook
(modifying as necessary for your use case).
Finally, check the changes that will be made and commit them to your repository.

```python
import nbformat as nbf
from glob import glob

# Collect a list of all notebooks in the content folder
notebooks = glob("./content/**/*.ipynb", recursive=True)

# Text to look for in adding tags
text_search_dict = {
    "# HIDDEN": "remove-cell",  # Remove the whole cell
    "# NO CODE": "remove-input",  # Remove only the input
    "# HIDE CODE": "hide-input"  # Hide the input w/ a button to show
}

# Search through each notebook and look for the text, add a tag if necessary
for ipath in notebooks:
    ntbk = nbf.read(ipath, nbf.NO_CONVERT)

    for cell in ntbk.cells:
        cell_tags = cell.get('metadata', {}).get('tags', [])
        for key, val in text_search_dict.items():
            if key in cell['source']:
                if val not in cell_tags:
                    cell_tags.append(val)
        if len(cell_tags) > 0:
            cell['metadata']['tags'] = cell_tags

    nbf.write(ntbk, ipath)
```
