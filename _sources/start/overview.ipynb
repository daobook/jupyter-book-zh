    "\n",
    "1. **Create your book's content**. You structure your book with a collection of folders, files, and configuration. See [](anatomy-of-a-book).\n",

    "   convert your pages into either an HTML or a PDF book. See [](build.md).\n",
    "3. **Publish your book online**. Once your book is built, you can share it with others. Most common is to build HTML, and host it as a public website. See [](publish.md).\n",

    "## Anatomy of a Jupyter Book\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three things that you need in order to build a Jupyter Book:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A configuration file (`_config.yml`)\n",
    "- A table of contents file (`_toc.yml`)\n",
    "- Your book's content\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following folder structure, which makes up a simple Jupyter Book.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mybookname/\n",
    "├── _config.yml\n",
    "├── _toc.yml\n",
    "├── landing-page.md\n",
    "└── page1.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover each briefly below, and you can find more information about them\n",
    "elsewhere in this documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Book configuration (`_config.yml`)\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the configuration for your book is in a YAML file called `_config.yml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define metadata for your book (such as its title), add\n",
    "a book logo, turn on different \"interactive\" buttons (such as a\n",
    "{term}`Binder` button for pages built from a Jupyter Notebook), and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "For more information about your book's configuration file, see\n",
    "[](../customize/config.md).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a simple `_config.yml` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# in _config.yml\n",
    "title: \"My book title\"\n",
    "logo: images/logo-wide.svg\n",
    "execute:\n",
    "  execute_notebooks: \"off\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `title:` defines a title for the book. It will show up in the left sidebar.\n",
    "- `logo:` defines a path to an image file for your book's logo (it will also show up in the sidebar).\n",
    "- `execute:` contains a collection of configuration options to control [execution and cacheing](../content/execute.md).\n",
    "  - `execute_notebooks: \"off\"` tells Jupyter Book **not to execute** any computational content that it finds when building the book. By default, Jupyter Book executes and caches all book content.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} More about `_config.yml`\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "There is much more that you can do with the `_config.yml` file. For example, you can [](source-repository-button) or add [](../interactive/interactive.ipynb). For a complete list of fields for `_config.yml`, see [](../customize/config.md).\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Table of Contents (`_toc.yml`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Book uses your Table of Contents to define the structure of your book.\n",
    "For example, your chapters, sub-chapters, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a YAML file with a collection of pages, each one linking to a\n",
    "file in your book. Here's an example of the two content files shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{margin}\n",
    "If you would like to quickly **generate a basic Table of Contents** YAML file,\n",
    "run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter-book toc mybookname/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And it will generate a TOC for you. Note that there must be at least one content\n",
    "file in each folder in order for any sub-folders to be parsed.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# In _toc.yml\n",
    "- file: landing-page\n",
    "- file: page1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each item in the `_toc.yml` file points to a single file. The links\n",
    "should be **relative to your book's folder and with no extension.**\n",
    "Think of the top-most level of your TOC file as **book chapters** (excluding the landing page). The title of each chapter will be inferred from the title in your files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first file specifies the **landing page** of your book (in this case, it is a **markdown file**).\n",
    "The landing page is the highest page in your book's content hierarchy.\n",
    "The second file specifies a **content page** of your book (in this case, it is a **Jupyter Notebook**).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "For more information about how section structure maps onto book structure,\n",
    "see [](toc/structure).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} More about `_toc.yml`\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "You can specify more complex book configurations with your `_toc.yml` file. For example, you can specify **parts**, **sections**, and control **custom titles**. For more information about your book's table of contents file, see [](../customize/toc.md).\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Book content\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection of text files make up your book's content. These can be one of several types of files, such as markdown (`.md`), Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) or reStructuredText (`.rst`) files (see [](../file-types/index.md) for a full list).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, there were two files listed: a **markdown** file and a **Jupyter Notebook**.\n",
    "We'll cover each in the next section."
