# Commenting and annotating

```{danger}
This is an experimental feature that may change quickly!
If you're interested in trying this out, we recommend using the `master` branch
version of Jupyter Book.
```

You can add functionality for web commenting and annotating through a number of web services and tools. These allow readers of your book to share conversations, ideas and questions in a centralized location. It is useful for classes, communities of practice, asking for user feedback, etc.

Currently, these commenting engines are supported:

- [Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is/) provides a web overlay that allows you to annotate and comment collaboratively.
- [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) is a web commenting system that uses GitHub Issues to store and manage comments.

```{note}
Jupyter Book uses the [`sphinx-comments`](https://sphinx-comments.readthedocs.io/) Sphinx extension for this functionality.
```
