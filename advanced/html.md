# Advanced HTML outputs


(custom-assets)=
## Custom CSS or JavaScript

If you'd like to include custom CSS rules or JavaScript scripts in your book, add them to a folder called `_static` in your book's folder.
Any files that end in `.css` or `.js` in this folder will automatically be copied into your built book HTML and linked in the header of each page.

For example, to include a custom CSS file `myfile.css` in a Jupyter Book folder with the following structure:

```
mybook/
├── _config.yml
├── _toc.yml
└── page1.md
```

Add the static file here:

```
├── _config.yml
├── _toc.yml
├── page1.md
└── _static
    └── myfile.css
```

The rules should then automatically be applied to your site. In general, these
CSS and JS files will be loaded *after* others are loaded on your page, so they
should overwrite pre-existing rules and behaviour.

### An example: justify the text

If you want the text of you book to be justified instead of left aligned then create `myfile.css` under `mybook/_static` with the following CSS:

```css
p {
    text-align: justify;
}
```

## Enable Google Analytics

If you have a Google account, you can use Google Analytics to collect some
information on the traffic to your Jupyter Book. With this tool, you can find
out how many people are using your book, where they come from and how they
access it, whether they are using the desktop or the mobile version etc.

To add Google Analytics to your Jupyter Book, navigate to
[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/), create a new
Google Analytics account and add the url of your Jupyter Book to a new
*property*. Once you have set everything up, your Google Analytics property
will have a so-called Tracking-ID, that typically starts with the letters UA.
All that you need to do is to copy this ID and paste it into your
configuration file:

```yaml
html:
  google_analytics_id: UA-XXXXXXXXX-X
```

(html:link-check)=
## Check external links in your book

If you'd like to make sure that the links outside of your book are valid,
run the Sphinx link checker with Jupyter Book. This will check each of your
external links and ensure that they resolve.

```{margin}
Note that you must ensure each link is
the *right* target, the link checker will only ensure that it resolves.
```

To run the link checker, use the following command:

```bash
jupyter-book build mybookname/ --builder linkcheck
```

It will print the status of each link in your book so that you may resolve
any incorrect links later on.

(raw-html-in-markdown)=
## Use raw HTML in Markdown

Jupyter Notebook Markdown allows you to use raw HTML in Markdown cells.
This is discouraged in most cases,
because it will usually just be passed through the build process as raw text, and so will not be subject to processes like:

- relative path corrections
- copying of assets to the build folder
- multiple output type formatting (e.g. it will not show in PDFs!).

So, for instance, below we add:

```md
<a href="../README.md">Go Home HTML!</a>

[Go Home Markdown!](../README.md)
```

and you will find that the HTML link is broken:

<a href="../README.md">Go Home HTML!</a>

[Go Home Markdown!](../README.md)

:::{tip}
Note that MyST Markdown now has some extended syntax features,
which can allow you to use certain HTML elements in the correct manner.

For example, the raw HTML image tag

```html
<img src="../images/fun-fish.png" alt="the fun fish!" width="200px"/>
```

becomes

<img src="../images/fun-fish.png" alt="the fun fish!" width="200px"/>

See the [image section](content-blocks-images) for details.

## Adding extra HTML to your book

There are a few places in Jupyter Book where you can add extra arbitrary HTML.
In all cases, this is done with a configuration value in your `_config.yml` file.

### Extra HTML in your footer

To add extra HTML in your book's footer, use the following configuration:

```yaml
html:
    extra_footer: |
        <div>
            your html
        </div>
```

The contents of `extra_footer` will be inserted into your page's HTML after
all other footer content.

### Extra HTML to your left navbar

To add extra HTML in your book's left navbar, use the following configuration:

```yaml
html:
    extra_navbar: |
        <div>
            your html
        </div>
```

The contents of `extra_navbar` will be inserted into your page's HTML after
all other HTML content.

## Adding a license to your HTML footer

If you'd like to add a more detailed license for your book, or would like to
add a link to an external page for a license, the easiest way to do so is to
use a custom footer for this. You can disable the "copyright" text that is
automatically added to each footer, and add whatever footer HTML you'd like.

For example, see this configuration:

```yaml
html:
  extra_footer: |
    <p>
    ... Add license info here...
    </p>
sphinx:
  config:
    html_show_copyright: false
```

Note that this may not work in PDF builds of your page generated by LaTeX.


(sphinx:manual-assets)=
## Manually specify extra files/folders to be included in a website

Jupyter Book will copy over any files that are linked from within its pages so that the links work in the built website.
However, sometimes you'd like to manually ensure that files and folders are included in your built website.
For example, if you'd like to link to them from *outside* your built documentation, but not from within your built documentation.

To manually specify items to copy over, use the [`html_extra_path` Sphinx configuration](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-html_extra_path).
You can configure this with Jupyter Book like so:

```yaml
sphinx:
  config:
    html_extra_path: ['folder1', 'folder2']
```

When you build your book's HTML, Jupyter Book will ensure that all files and folders _inside_ the folders specified in `html_extra_path` will be copied over to your built website.

For example, if you have a folder structure in your book like so:

```bash
assets
└── data
    └── mydataset.csv
```

and the following Jupyter Book configuration:

```yaml
sphinx:
  config:
    html_extra_path: ['assets']
```

Then the dataset will be accessible at `yourwebsite.com/data/mydataset.csv`.

## Configuring to Improve Accessibility

Declaring the primary language used in your book assists screen reader and browser translation tools.

Language can be configured by providing the appropriate [language code](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) to the `language` option, under `sphinx` configuration in your `_config.yml` file:

```yaml
sphinx:
  config:
    language: en
```

This example will set the book language to English, which would be represented in your book's HTML as `<html lang="en">...</html>`.
